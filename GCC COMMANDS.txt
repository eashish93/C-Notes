To check whether GCC compiler is correctly installed
type the following command in the Command line 
gcc --version   {If you installed C compiler}
g++ --version   {If you installed C++ compiler}

To Compile and link the program
cc program.c (generate default program name `a`)
gcc -o filename cprogam.c
or
gcc filename -o cprogram.c

// To check for error and warnings in the program, compile with options
cc filename -Wall 

To See the output of the preprocessor use:

gcc cprogram.c -E


// In Linux, exe can be run (in current directry)
./a.out  	(where `a` is the default generated file)


To take input from file and write output to file. Use the following command:
For eg: For .txt files
 program < input.txt > output.txt

 When this command executes, it will read its standard input from the file `input.txt` instead of keyboard and it will write its
 standard output to file `output.txt`.



To compile file from a directory (suppose `lib/some_function.c`, use like 
cc sdf.c lib/some_functions.c (in linux and windows both)
 
 	or
cc sdf.c ./lib/some_functions.c (in linux only - above is preferred)
	or 

best use makefile

// Note, there is a `-B` option is not used for above. It's only used for search compiler files. 
// Also, it can be use in place of `-L` or `-I`


/** We can also use `-L` option to set directory path (but this is only for libraries search not files)





cls --- clear the screen
cc (or gcc) -- for compiling program
cd.. ( one step back on previous folder)
dir (listing directories and files)
c: (or d: or any drive name) 
cd foldername (move into that folder)
